# Digital Garden

## Introduction

Digital Garden is an e-commerce shop which curates products to be sold from rural farmers and producers all around Japan.

Japan is currently facing an unprecedented super-ageing demographic change, with the highest proportion of elderly citizens in the world and population decline as a result of decreasing birth rate. The rural regions of Japan are most affected by this demographic change, with a majority of villages and towns suffering from depopulation.

Japanâ€™s current Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, has shared his Vision for a Digital Garden City Nation, which includes initiatives to bring digital transformations to rural areas. digitalgarden aims to tackle Initiative III: Implementing digital services to solve rural issues, by providing a platform for farmers and producers living in rural regions to sell their products direct-to-consumer.

Consumers, in-turn, will receive fresh products made in their country, supporting the circular economy.
